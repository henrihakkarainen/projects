# Travel Planning Web Application

This is my first JavaScript web-application. When started, it first asks for a travelers name and after submitting a valid name (more than 2 characters) it fetches all countries from a REST API and then randomly selects 3 countries and lists them on the web page. The user can then click on the countries and the page updates so that the neighbouring countries of the chosen country are listed on the next tier. If a country has been clicked previously, it doesn't show up second time. When no more unique neighbouring countries exist the user can view a travel summary.

This application can be used for planning a backpack-journey for example.

To start the application, just download the contents inside this folder and open file ` harjoitustyo.html ` on the browser.
