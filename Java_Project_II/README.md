# Simple HashTable simulation

When started, the application reads the contents of files ` setA.txt ` and ` setB.txt ` and creates two hashtables that contain the numbers listed in those two files. The user is then prompted to remove some numbers from the tables and after the user is done deleting numbers, the application forms UNION, INTERSECTION and XOR operations from the hashtables. Hashtable and the nodes used inside the hashtable are self created instead of using Java's own HashMap-class.

Comments on code and User Interface are in finnish.

To run the application, download this folder and on terminal run command
